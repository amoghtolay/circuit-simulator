circuit-simulator
=================

This was a curriculum project that asked us to build a simulator for logical circuits. It had to be a system that is running on the server, and users keep queuing their submissions and each user gets a fixed time-slice of the simulator. They can work offline and create their circuits (using the downloadable open source editor called Logic Gate Simulator 1.4 - thanks to the open source software provided at http://www.kolls.net/gatesim).
